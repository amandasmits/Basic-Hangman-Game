# Basic-Hangman-Game
A basic Hangman game in python
This project is a basic hangman game program. It is one python file, and it just plays a basic game of hangman. It reprints the picture of the guy every time a mistake is made, not every time a guess is made which is something that could be edited. It will tell you if the same letter has been guessed multiple times and it won't count them as mistakes. It also declares 6 different functions, one to draw each mistake, however I think there might be a way to do it in one function with nested loops and a counter, which also needs further exploration. It doesn't loop back to itself at the end of the game either, but to fix that the main function could be called at the end, which it will be if I can edit it in github. It was programmed in VSCode originally.
